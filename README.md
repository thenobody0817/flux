# Flux

Connect your Omarchy desktop and Android phone over your local network.
Share files and clipboard text, read phone notifications, control media, and use your phone as a camera or microphone.

Flux includes a CLI, a background daemon, a native Qt window, an Omarchy shell plugin, and a native Android app.
The desktop opens the network connections, so the default Omarchy firewall needs no new inbound rule.

## Clone and install

On Omarchy or Arch Linux, install the build tools:

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed base-devel git go cmake ninja
```

Replace `OWNER` with the GitHub owner of this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OWNER/omarchy-flux.git
cd omarchy-flux/dist/arch
makepkg -si
flux setup
flux doctor
flux open
```

The package includes the Qt app, CLI, daemon, shell plugin, approval helper, desktop entry, icons, and system files.
Run `flux setup` as your desktop user after installation.

The [install guide](docs/install.md) covers dependencies, source builds, user-only installation, updates, and removal.

## Connect your phone

1. [Install Flux for Android](docs/android.md).
2. Connect the phone and desktop to the same local network.
3. Open the desktop window with `flux open`.
4. Select **+ Pair new device**.
5. Compare the 8-character verification key on both screens.
6. Accept the matching request on the phone.

You can also start the pair request from a terminal:

```sh
flux pair "Pixel 8"
```

## Use it from your terminal

```sh
flux status
flux send "$HOME/Downloads/report.txt"
flux clip
flux url https://omarchy.org
flux ring
flux media play-pause
flux notify --run -- make test
```

To select one of multiple connected phones, add `--device`:

```sh
flux --device "Pixel 8" send "$HOME/Downloads/report.txt"
```

See the [CLI reference](docs/cli.md) for commands and script examples.

## Build and release

```sh
make build test vet
make android
```

GitHub Actions builds the complete Arch package and Android APKs for pull requests and the `main` branch.
Stable version tags produce a signed APK, an Arch package, an AUR recipe, and checksums.
The optional AUR job publishes the tested recipe after the GitHub release succeeds.

See [development](docs/development.md) for local checks and [releases](docs/releasing.md) for keys, secrets, tags, and artifacts.
