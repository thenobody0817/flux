description: Use, install, diagnose, develop, and release Omarchy Flux. Use this skill for the flux CLI, fluxd, Flux for Android, phone pairing, file or clipboard transfers, phone notifications, webcam or microphone streams, screen mirror, fingerprint approval, the Flux Qt app, the Flux Omarchy plugin, AUR packages, and Flux APK workflows. Scope this skill to Flux tasks, not general Android or Omarchy configuration.

# Omarchy Flux

Flux connects an Omarchy desktop to Flux for Android on the same local network.
The desktop includes the `flux` CLI, `fluxd`, a Qt app, and an Omarchy shell plugin.

## Choose the task

| Task | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Pair a phone, use the CLI, change settings, or diagnose a connection | [Runtime reference](references/runtime.md) |
| Build, install, test, package, or release Flux | [Build and release reference](references/build-release.md) |
| Change the source | Read the relevant files in the repository and the topic in `docs/README.md`. |
| Change fingerprint approval | Read `docs/approve.md` before you edit the approval code. |

Find the repository from the working directory or ask for its path.
Do not assume that an installed skill lives inside the repository.
Run repository commands from its root unless the reference names another directory.

## Start with the current state

For an installed Flux system, run:

```sh
flux version
flux status --json
flux doctor
```

For source work, run:

```sh
git status --short
git remote -v
```

Preserve existing changes.
Use the configured Git remote for clone and release URLs.
If no remote exists, ask for the repository URL before a remote operation.

`flux setup` prints failures but can still return zero.
Inspect its output and confirm the result with `flux doctor` and `flux status --json`.

## Operate Flux

1. Find the requested phone in `flux status --json`.
2. Select its device ID when more than one phone is present.
3. Run the requested command from the runtime reference.
4. Check the result from the command or the next state event.

Example:

```sh
flux status --json
flux --device "Pixel 8" send "$HOME/Downloads/report.txt"
flux status --json
```

The send command starts a transfer.
Check `transfers` in the state before you report that the file arrived.

Use `flux status --json` for scripts.
Use `flux watch` only when the task needs a continuous event stream.
Stop the watch process when the task ends.

`flux` without arguments opens a window.
Use an explicit command for diagnostics.

## Pair and connect

1. Check that both devices use the same local network.
2. Open Flux for Android.
3. Run `flux discover`.
4. Run `flux pair "Pixel 8"` with the device name from the state.
5. Ask the user to compare the verification key on both devices.
6. Let the user accept the matching request on the phone.
7. Confirm that the device is paired and online.

The desktop discovers phones through Avahi and mDNS.
The desktop opens connections to the phone, including reverse payload tunnels.
A missing connection does not require a new desktop firewall rule by default.
Check the daemon, Avahi, Wi-Fi isolation, and phone state first.

## Respect the requested operation

SMS, notifications, clipboard transfers, and file transfers affect another device.
Use the destination and content that the user requests.
Keep private keys, notification contents, phone numbers, and signing secrets out of reports unless the task needs them.

Pairing needs the user's key comparison.
Fingerprint enrollment needs the user's fingerprint and key comparison.
Do not claim that these physical steps succeeded without evidence.

Use `flux commands add` for desktop commands that the phone can run.
`flux run ID` runs a configured command on the desktop, not on the phone.
Do not expand a command's permissions beyond the user's request.

## Install locally

Prefer the Arch package for a complete install on Omarchy.
It includes the Qt app, CLI, daemon, plugin assets, PAM helper, desktop entry, icons, and system files.

From the repository root:

```sh
make build
sudo make install
flux setup
flux doctor
```

The root install performs system setup.
Run `flux setup` as the desktop user.
Use `docs/install.md` for dependencies, the pacman package, and the user-only install.

For a preview without installation:

```sh
make build
./bin/flux setup --dry-run
```

## Develop the correct component

| Component | Source |
| --- | --- |
| CLI | `cmd/flux/` |
| Daemon entry point | `cmd/fluxd/` |
| Device state and IPC methods | `internal/core/` |
| Network and protocol | `internal/lan/`, `internal/proto/` |
| Configuration and trust | `internal/config/` |
| Desktop integration | `internal/desktop/` |
| Shared Qt views | `gui/qml/` |
| Qt host | `gui/app/` |
| Omarchy shell host | `gui/omarchy/` |
| Android app | `android/app/src/main/java/org/omarchy/flux/` |
| Fingerprint approval | `internal/approve/`, `cmd/flux-approve/`, Android `core/Approve*` |
| eyec prompts | `internal/core/eyec.go`, Android `core/Eyec.kt`, `docs/eyec.md` |
| Package and system install | `dist/`, `Makefile` |

Keep network state in `fluxd`.
The CLI and both desktop hosts use its Unix socket.
Keep shared QML free of Quickshell imports.
Update both host adapters when you change their shared backend contract.
Test wire changes on both Go and Kotlin implementations.

Use the existing tests for the component you change.
Run these checks for a complete build change:

```sh
make build test vet
cd android
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug :app:assembleDebug :app:assembleRelease --no-daemon
```

Use `docs/development.md` for isolated daemon tests and UI snapshots.
Do not run a second development daemon against the user's active socket or trust store.

## Release

Read the build and release reference before you change workflows or prepare a tag.
The workflows support stable tags in `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` form.
The release workflow checks out that tag for both desktop and Android builds.

Keep one Android release key across releases.
The workflow requires signing secrets and refuses a debug-signed APK.
The AUR recipe includes a source checksum and the install hook.
The AUR job uses the tested recipe only after the GitHub release succeeds.

Do not create a tag, push, publish, or change repository secrets unless the user requests that action.
For preparation work, report the required setup and the commands without running the remote action.

## Report the result

Include:

- The completed operation or changed files.
- The selected device or release tag when relevant.
- The checks that passed.
- Any check that failed or could not run.
- The next required user action, such as a phone prompt or a release secret.

Distinguish a successful local build from a published release.
Distinguish a queued transfer from a completed transfer.
