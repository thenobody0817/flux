# Flux documentation

Flux connects an Omarchy desktop to Flux for Android or Flux for macOS on the same local network.
A paired device can also connect through [Tailscale](tailscale.md) away from that network.

## Start here

1. [Clone and install Flux](install.md).
2. [Install the Android app](android.md) or [build the Mac app](macos.md#build-and-run).
3. [Pair your phone](features.md#pair-a-phone) or [pair your Mac](macos.md#pair-a-mac).
4. [Use the CLI](cli.md) or open the window with `flux-cli open`.
