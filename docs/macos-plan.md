# macOS client plan

[Documentation index](README.md)

This plan builds Flux for macOS: a native Swift and SwiftUI app that takes the place of the Android phone app toward `fluxd`.
It uses KDE Connect protocol version 8 with the Flux extensions and offers the Android features that macOS allows.
See [status](macos-status.md) for the details of each check and [Flux for macOS](macos.md) for use.

## Decisions

- [x] The Mac is a device peer that replaces the Android app, not the Omarchy desktop side.
- [x] Native Swift and SwiftUI, macOS 14 or later.
- [x] SwiftNIO and swift-nio-ssl for links, because the protocol reads a plain-text identity and then starts TLS on the same socket.
- [x] swift-certificates and swift-crypto for the KDE Connect certificate and the verification key.
- [x] XcodeGen project in `macos/project.yml`; the generated project stays out of Git.
- [x] One `FluxPlugin` per feature, composed in `macos/App/Features/Features.swift` with one line per entry.
- [x] Wire formats follow the Android app and the Go handlers exactly.
- [x] The Mac announces only the capabilities it implements.

## Phase 0: Setup

- [x] Fork `bjarneo/flux` to `rogerznts/flux`, with `origin` on the fork and `upstream` on the original.
- [x] Map the Android peer: `protocol`, `net`, `core`, and each feature folder.
- [x] Map the Go peer: `internal/lan`, `internal/proto`, `internal/core`.
- [x] Build a macOS test copy of `fluxd` and `flux-cli` with `go build -overlay`, with no change to the Go sources.
- [x] Run `fluxd -headless` with isolated XDG paths and custom ports as the test peer.

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Protocol

- [x] `JSONValue` that accepts the loose types KDE Connect peers send.
- [x] `Packet` with payload fields for a port or a tunnel.
- [x] `Identity`, packet types, device ID rules, and name cleanup.
- [x] RSA 2048 self-signed certificate with CN set to the device ID.
- [x] SubjectPublicKeyInfo taken from the certificate bytes as stored.
- [x] 8-character verification key.
- [x] Unit tests for packets, identity, certificates, and the key.

### Network

- [x] TLS 1.2 with both sides presenting a certificate, and the pin check after the handshake.
- [x] UDP identity broadcasts and a receiver on port 1716.
- [x] TCP listener on ports 1716 to 1764 and a dialer for UDP identities.
- [x] Plain-text identity, then TLS on the same socket, then the identity again inside TLS.
- [x] Links with packet framing and buffering before start.
- [x] Payload server and client on ports 1739 to 1764.
- [x] `flux.tunnel` listener with the pinned certificate.
- [x] Bonjour publish and browse for `_kdeconnect._udp`.
- [x] Test variables: `FLUX_DATA_DIR`, `FLUX_UDP_PORT`, `FLUX_PEER_UDP_PORT`, `FLUX_LOOPBACK`.

### Core

- [x] `FluxCore` with devices, links, state snapshots, and toasts.
- [x] Pairing in both directions with timeouts and the timestamp check.
- [x] `TrustStore` with pinned certificates.
- [x] `FluxPlugin` protocol with routing by packet type.
- [x] One shared `Notifier` for UserNotifications.
- [x] `PingPlugin`.

### Foundation checks against fluxd

- [x] The Mac appears online on the computer as `laptop`.
- [x] Pairing from the computer.
- [x] Pairing from the Mac with the same key on both sides.
- [x] Ping in both directions.
- [x] Unpair from the computer.
- [x] Reconnect after a restart with the pinned certificate.

## Phase 2: App shell

- [x] Sidebar with paired and available computers.
- [x] Pairing screens and the pairing request sheet.
- [x] Device dashboard: header with state, IP, battery, and quick actions (Send Files, Send Clipboard, Browse Files, Ping).
- [x] Banners for an open approval request and an offline computer.
- [x] Feature cards in a grid of equal columns, with equal heights per row.
- [x] Collapsible card details, saved per card: webcam image settings and approval details.
- [x] Settings window with General and Features tabs.
- [x] App icon with the Flux mark, dark in the bundle and light in the Dock in light mode.
- [x] **Settings > General > Appearance** (Automatic, Light, Dark) for the windows and the Dock icon.
- [x] Menu bar extra that keeps Flux running after the window closes, with the Flux mark of `dist/flux-symbolic.svg`, dimmed while no computer is connected.
- [x] Pairing request notification with Accept and Reject.
- [x] Pairing through the app UI against `fluxd`.

## Phase 3: Features

Each feature gets its own branch, worktree, and isolated `fluxd`, then merges into `macos-client`.
